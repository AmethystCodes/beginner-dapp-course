## Chapter 1.0 Day 1 Quests

**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp**

Blockchain is a database that is publicly avaliable and stores information in a digital format. Information is collected and stored in blocks. Once a block is filled, it's linked to previously filled blocks and forms a chain of data (or blockchain). Changing data on the blockchain is very difficult and cannot always be changed.

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts**

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when pretermined conditions within the contract are met. Once the predetermined conditions are met and verified, a network of computers will execute the actions of the smart contract.

**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

A script is used to view transactions that occur on the blockchain. Scripts do not make changes on the blockchain, they're used only to view data.

A transaction is used to make changes to the blockchain and is a paid function call. Different from using a script, transactions cost money to execute. Transactions are usually the only way that changes to the data on the blockchain can be made.

**4. What is the difference between Testnet and Mainnet? When would you develop on each?**

Testnet is just that, a testing environment where developers can test their applications prior to releasing the application to mainnet and the public. On mainnet, everything is real and cost money unlike on testnet where "fake" money is used.
