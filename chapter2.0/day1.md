## Chapter 2.0 Day 1 Quests

**1. What is the difference between frontend and backend? Can you provide a real life example (you can't use the one in this chapter)?**

Frontend involves the functionality of a website, like clicking on a button, and how a website looks when it is viewed by a user. Backend developments are not usually not seen by the user but typically involve working with databases, architecture, and APIs to name a few. 

**2. What is the difference between global styling and module styling?**

* **Global styling:** applies to everything on the site
* **Module styling:** applies to the files that it's imported in; applies using the `styles` keyword in components

**3. Take a screenshot of the running application and upload it to your quest submissions.**
